## Variables and Data Types

In Kotlin, variables are declared using two keywords:
- val for immutable variables (values that can't be changed).
- var for mutable variables (values that can be changed).
  Example:

```kotlin
val name: String = "John"  // immutable variable
var age: Int = 25          // mutable variable
```

```kotlin
// Variable declared without initialization
// Triggers an error
val d: Int 

```

You can also let Kotlin infer the type:

```kotlin
val country = "USA"        // Kotlin infers that 'country' is of type String
var temperature = 30       // 'temperature' is of type Int
```

```kotlin
var customers= 10

// Some customers leave the queue

customers = 8

customers = customers + 3 // Example of addition: 11
customers += 7            // Example of addition: 18
customers -= 3            // Example of subtraction: 15
customers *= 2            // Example of multiplication: 30
customers /= 3            // Example of division: 10
```

In total, Kotlin has the following basic types:

| Category | Basic types | Example code                                             |
|----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Integers | `Byte`, `Short`, `Int`, `Long` | val year: Int = 2020                                     |
| Unsigned Integers | `UByte`, `UShort`, `UInt`, `ULong` | val score: UInt = 100u                                   |
| Floating-point numbers| `Float`, `Double` | val currentTemp: Float= 24.5f, val price: Double = 19.99 |
| Booleans | `Boolean` | val isEnabled: Boolean = true                            |
| Characters | `Char` | val seperator: Char = ','   |
| Strings | `String` | val message: String = "Hello, world!"|

For more information on basic types and their properties, see [Basic types](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html)


## Collections

When programming, it's useful to be able to group data for later processing.
Kotlin provides collections for exactly this purpose.

Kotlin has the following collections for grouping items:

| Collection type | Description |
|----------|----------|
| Lists | Ordered collections of items|
|Sets| Unique unordered collections of items |
| Map | Sets of key-value pairs where keys are unique and map to only one value |

Each collection type can be mutable or read only.

#### List

Lists store items in the order that they are added, and allow for duplicate items.

To create a read-only ([List](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-list/)), use the [listOf()](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/list-of.html) function.

To create a mutable list ([MutableList](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-mutable-list.html)), use the [mutableListOf()](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/mutable-list-of.html) function.

When creating lists, Kotlin can infer the type of items stored. To declare the type explicitly, add the type within angled brackets `<>` after the list declaration:

```kotlin
// Read only list
val readOnlyShapes = listOf("triangle","square","circle")
println(readOnlyShapes) // [triangle, square, circle]

// Mutable list with explicit type declaration
val shapes: MutableList<String> = mutableListOf("triangle","square", "circle")
println(shapes) // [triangle, square, circle]

```

>âœ¨ To prevent unwanted modifications, you can create a read-only view of mutable list by assigning it to a `List`:
> 
>   ```kotlin
>   val shapes: MutableList<String> = mutableListOf("triangle", "square", "circle")
>   val shapesLocked: List<String> = shapes
>   ```
> 
This is also called **casting**

Lists are ordered so to access an item in a list, use the indexed access operator `[]`:

```kotlin
val readOnlyShapes= listOf("triangle", "square", "circle")
println("The first item in the list is: ${readOnlyShapes[0]}") // The first item in the list is: triangle
```
To get the first or last item in a list, use [.first()]() and [.last()]() functions respectively:

```kotlin
val readOnlyShapes= listOf("triangle", "square", "circle")
println("The first item in the list is: ${readOnlyShapes.first()}") // The first item in the list is: triangle
```

To get the number of items in a list, use the [.count()]() function:

```kotlin
val readOnlyShapes= listOf("triangle", "square", "circle")
println("The list has ${readOnlyShapes.count()} items") // The list has 3 items
```

To check that an item is in a list, use the [in]() operator:

```kotlin
val readOnlyShapes= listOf("triangle", "square", "circle")
println("circle" in readOnlyShapes) // true
```

To add or remove items from a mutable list, use [.add()]() and [.remove()]() functions respectively:


```kotlin
val shapes: MutableList<String> = mutableListOf("triangle", "square", "circle")
// Add "pentagon" to the list
shapes.add("pentagon")
println(shapes) // [triangle, square, circle, pentagon]

// Remove the first "pentagon" in the list
shapes.remove("pentagon")
println(shapes) // [triangle, square, circle]
```

#### Set

Whereas lists are ordered and allow duplicate items, sets are unordered and only store unique items.

To create a read-only set ([Set]()), use [setOf()]() function.

To create a mutable set ([MutableSet]()), use the [mutableSetOf()]() function.

When creating sets, Kotlin can infer the type of items stored. To declare the type explicitly, add the type within angled brackets `<>` after the set declaration:


```kotlin
// Read-only set
val readOnlyFruit= setOf("apple", "banana", "cherry", "cherry")
// Mutable set
val fruit: MutableSet<String> = mutableSetOf("apple", "banana", "cherry", "cherry")
println(readOnlyFruit) // [apple, banana, cherry]
```

You can see in the previous example that because sets only contain unique elements, the duplicate "cherry" item is dropped.


>âœ¨ To prevent unwanted modifications, you can create a read-only view of a mutable set by assigning it to a `Set`:
>   ```kotlin
>   val fruit: MutableSet<String> = mutableSetOf("apple", "banana", "cherry")
>   val fruitLocked: Set<String> = fruit
>   ```

As sets are unordered, you can't access an item at a particular index.

To get the number of items in a set, use [.count()]() function:

```kotlin
val readOnlyFruit = setOf("apple", "banana", "cherry", "cherry")
println("This set has ${readOnlyFruit.count()} items") // This set has 3 items
```

To check that an item is in a set, use the [in]() operator:

```kotlin
val readOnlyFruit = setOf("apple", "banana", "cherry", "cherry")
println("banana" in readOnlyFruit) // true
```

To add or remove items from a mutable set, use [.add()]() and [.remove()]() functions respectively:

```kotlin
val fruit: MutableSet<String> = mutableSetOf("apple", "banana", "cherry", "cherry")
fruit.add("dragonfruit") // Add "dragonfruit" to the set
println(fruit) // [apple, banana, cherry, dragonfruit]

fruit.remove("dragonfruit") // Remove "dragonfruit" from the set
println(fruit) // [apple, banana, cherry]

```
#### Map

Maps store items as key-value pairs. You access the value by referencing the key. You can imagine a map like a food menu. You can find the print (value), by finding the food (key) you to eat. Maps are useful if you want to look up a value without using a numbered index, like in a list.

- Every key in map must be unique so that Kotlin can understand which value you want to get.

- You can have duplicate values in a map.

To create a read-only map ([Map]()), use the [mapOf()]() function.

To create a mutable map ([MutableMap]()), use the [mutableOf()]() function.

When creating maps, Kotlin can infer the type of items stored. To declare the type explicitly, add the types of the keys and values within angled brackets `<>` after the map declaration. For example: `MutableMap<String,Int>`. The keys have type `String` and the values have type `Int`.

The easiest way to create maps is to use [to]() between each key and its related value:

```kotlin
val readOnlyJuiceMenu = mapOf("apple" to 100, "kiwi" to 190, "orange" to 100)
println(readOnlyJuiceMenu) // {apple=100, kiwi= 190, orange= 100}
```

>âœ¨ To prevent unwanted modifications, you can create a read-only view of a mutable map by assigning it to a `Map`:
>
>   ```kotlin
>   val juiceMenu: MutableMap<String,Int> = mutableMapOf("apple" to 100, "kiwi" to 190, "orange" to 100)
>   val juiceMenuLocked: Map<String,Int> = juiceMenu 
>    ```

To access a value in a map, use the indexed access operator `[]` with its key:

```kotlin
// Read-only map
val readOnlyJuiceMenu= mapOf("apple" to 100, "kiwi" to 190, "orange" to 100)
println("The value of apple juice is: ${readOnlyJuiceMenu["apple"]}") // The value of apple juice is 100

println("The value of cherry juice is: ${readOnlyJuiceMenu["cherry"]}") // The value of cherry juice is null
```

You can also use the indexed access operator `[]` to add items to a mutable map:

```kotlin
val juiceMenu: MutableMap<String,Int> = mutableMapOf("apple" to 100, "kiwi" to 190, "orange" to 100)
juiceMenu["coconut"] = 150 // Add key "coconut" with value 150 to the map
println(juiceMenu) // {apple=100, kiwi=190, orange=100}
```

To remove items from a mutable map, use the [.remove()]() function:

```kotlin
val juiceMenu: MutableMap<String,Int> = mutableMapOf("apple" to 100, "kiwi" to 190, "orange" to 100)
juiceMenu.remove("orange") // Remove key "orange" from the map
println(juiceMenu) // {apple=100, kiwi=190}
```

To get the number of items in a map, use the [.count()]() function:

```kotlin
// Read-only map
val readOnlyJuiceMenu= mapOf("apple" to 100, "kiwi" to 190, "orange" to 100)
println("This map has ${readOnlyJuiceMenu.count()} key-value pairs")

```
To check if a specific key is already included in a map, use the [.containsKey()]() function:

```kotlin
val readOnlyJuiceMenu= mapOf("apple" to 100, "kiwi" to 190, "orange" to 100)
println(readOnlyJuiceMenu.containsKey("kiwi")) // true
```

To obtain a collection of the keys or values of a map, use the [keys]() and [values]() properties respectively:

```kotlin
val readOnlyJuiceMenu= mapOf("apple" to 100, "kiwi" to 190, "orange" to 100)
println(readOnlyJuiceMenu.keys) // [apple, kiwi, orange]
println(readOnlyJuiceMenu.values) // [100, 190, 100]
```
For more information on what you can do with collections, see [Collections]()

## Control Structures

Kotlin has familiar control structures like `if`, `when`, `for` and `while`.

#### 1. If Statement:

The `if` statement works just like in many languages, but in Kotlin, it can also be an expression (it returns a value).

```kotlin
val max = if (a > b) a else b
```

#### 2. When Expression (similar to switch in other languages):

```kotlin
val day = 3
val dayName = when (day){
    1 -> "Monday"
    2 -> "Tuesday"
    3 -> "Wednesday"
    4 -> "Thursday"
    5 -> "Friday"
    6 -> "Saturday"
    7 -> "Sunday"
    else -> "Unknown"
}
val obj = "Hello"

```
`when` can also be used without a subject

This example uses a `when` expression **without** a subject to check a chain of Boolean expressions:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val trafficLightState = "Red" // This can be "Green", "Yellow", or "Red"
    val trafficLightAction = when {
        trafficLightState == "Green" -> "Go"
        trafficLightState == "Yellow" -> "Slow down"
        trafficLightState == "Red" -> "Stop"
        else->"Malfunction"
    }
    println(trafficLightAction) // Stop
}
```
However, you can have the same code but with `trafficLightState` as the subject:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val trafficLightState = "Red" // This can be "Green", "Yellow", or "Red"
    val trafficLightAction = when (trafficLightState) {
        "Green" -> "Go"
        "Yellow" -> "Slow down"
        "Red" -> "Stop"
        else->"Malfunction"
    }
    println(trafficLightAction) // Stop
}
```

#### 3. Ranges  

The most common way to create a range in Kotlin is to use the `..` operator. For example, 1..4 is equivalent to 1, 2, 3 ,4.

To declare a range that doesn't include the end value, use the `..<` operator. For example, 1..<4 is equivalent to 1, 2, 3.

To declare a range in reverse order, use `downTo`. For example, `4 downTo 1` is equivalent to 4, 3, 2, 1.

To declare a range that increments in a step that isn't 1, use `step` and your desired increment value. For example, `1..5 step 2` is equivalent to 1, 3, 5.

You can also do the same with `Char` ranges:

- `'a'..'b'` is equivalent to 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'
- `'z' downTo 's'` is equivalent to 'z', 'y', 'v', 't'



#### 4. `for` loop

`for` loops are typically used to iterate over ranges, arrays, or collections.

Base Syntax:

```kotlin
for (item in collection){
    // Do something with item
}
```

Example: Iterating over a Range

```kotlin
for (i in 1..5){
    println(i) // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
}
```

- 1..5 is range from 1 to 5 (inclusive).
- You can also use `until` if you don't want to include the last value:

```kotlin
for (i in 1 until 5){
    println(i)
}
```

Example: Iterating over an Array

```kotlin
val numbers = arrayOf(1,2,3,4,5)
for (i in numbers){
    println(i)
}
```

Example: Iterating with an index

If you need both the index and the value:

```kotlin
val items = listOf("apple","banana","kiwi")
for ((index,value) in items.withIndex()){
    println("Item at $index is $value")
}
```
#### 5. `while` loop

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the condition is true.

Basic Syntax:

```kotlin
while(condition){
    // Code to execute
}
```

Example: Basic `while` loop

```kotlin
var i = 5
while (i>0){
    println(i)
    i--
}
```
#### 6. `do-while` loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to `while`, but it guarantees that the block of code will execute at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

Basic Syntax: 

```kotlin
do {
    // Code to execute
} while(condition)
```

Example: `do-while` loop

```kotlin
var i = 5
do{
    println(i)
    i--
} while(i>0)
```


## Functions

You can declare our own functions in Kotlin using the `fun` keyword.

```kotlin
fun hello() {
    return println("Hello, world!")
}

fun main() {
    hello() // Hello, world!
}

```

In Kotlin:

- Function parameters are written within parentheses `()`.
- Each parameter must have a type, and multiple parameters must be separated by commas `,`.
- The return type is written after the function's parentheses(), separated by a colon `:`.
- The body of a function is written within curly braces `{}`.
- The `return` keyword is used to exit or return something from a function.

>âœ¨ If a function doesn't return anything useful, the return type and return keyword can be ommited. 

In the following example:

- `x` and `y` are function parameters.
- `x` and `y` have type `Int`.
- The function's return type is `Int`.
- The function returns a sum of `x` and `y` when called.

```kotlin
fun sum(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
    return x + y
}

fun main() {
    println(sum(1,2)) // 3
}
```
>âœ¨ We recommend in our coding conventions that you name functions starting with a lowercase letter and use camel case with no underscores.

#### Named arguments

For concise code, when calling your function, you don't have to include parameter names. However, including parameter names does make your code easier to read. This is called using **named parameters**. If you do include parameter names, then you can write the parameters in any order.


>âœ¨ In the following example, string templates (`$`) are used to access the parameter values, convert them to `String` type, and then concatenate them into a string for priting.


```kotlin
fun printMessageWithPrefix(message: String, prefix: String) {
    println("[$prefix] $message")
}

fun main() {
    // Uses named arguments with swapped parameter order
    printMessageWithPrefix(prefix = "Log", message = "hello")
}
```

#### Default parameter values

You can define default values for your function parameters. Any parameter with a default value can be omitted when calling your function. To declare a default value, use the assignment operator = after the type:

```kotlin
fun printMessageWithPrefix(message: String, prefix: String = "Info") {
    println("[$prefix] $message")
}

fun main() {
    // Function called with both parameters
    printMessageWithPrefix("Hello","Log") // [Log] Hello
    
    // Function called only with message
    printMessageWithPrefix("Hello") // [Info] Hello
  
    printMessageWithPrefix(prefix = "Log", message = "Hello") // [Log] Hello
}
```
>âœ¨ You can skip specific parameters with default values, rather than omitting them all. However, after the first skipped parameter, you must name all subsequent parameters.

#### Functions without return 

If your function doesn't return a useful value then its return type is `Unit`. `Unit` is a type with only one value - `Unit`. You don't have to declare that `Unit` is returned explicitly in your function body. This mean that you don't have to use `return` keyword or declare a return type:

```kotlin
fun printMessage(message: String){
    println(message)
    // return `Unit` or `return` is optional
}

fun main() {
    printMessage("Hello") // Hello
}
```

#### Single-expression functions 

To make your code more concise, you can use single-expression functions. For example, the `sum()` function can be shortened:

```kotlin
fun sum(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
  return x+y
}

fun main(){
    println(sum(1,2)) // 3
}
```

You can remove the curly braces `{}` and declare the function body using the assignment operator `=`. When you use the assignment operator `=`, Kotlin uses type inference, so you can also omit the return type. The `sum()` function then becomes one line:

```kotlin
fun sum(x: Int, y: Int) = x + y 

fun main() {
    println(sum(1,2)) // 3 
}
```

However, if you want your code to be quickly understood by other developers, it's a good idea to explicitly define the return type even when using the assignment operator `=`.

>âœ¨ If you use `{}` curly braces to declare your function body, you must declare the return type unless it's the `Unit` type.

#### Early returns in functions


To stop the code in your function from being processed further than a certain point, use `return` keyword. This example uses `if` to return from a function early if the conditional expression is found to be true:

```kotlin
// A list of usernames
val registeredUsernames= mutableListOf("john_doe", "jane_smith")

// A list of registered emails
val registeredEmails = mutableListOf("john@example.com", "jane@example.com")

fun registerUser(username: String, email: String): String{
   
    // Early return if the username is already taken
    if (username in registeredUsernames){
        return "Username already taken. Please choose a different username."
    }
  
    // Early return if the email is already registered
    if (email in registeredEmails){
        return "Email already taken. Please choose a different email."
    }
  
    // Proceed with registration if the username and email are not taken
  
    registeredUsernames.add(username)
    registeredEmails.add(email)
  return "User registered successfully: $username"
}

fun main(){
    
    println(registerUser(username = "john_doe", email = "newjohn@example.com")) // Username already taken. Please choose a different username.
    println(registerUser("new_user","newuser@example.com")) // User registered successfully: new_user
}
```

#### Lambda expressions

Kotlin allows you to write even more concise code for functions by using lambda expressions.

For example, the following `uppercaseString()` function:

```kotlin
fun uppercaseString(text: String): String {
    return text.uppercase()
}

fun main() {
    println(uppercaseString("hello")) // HELLO
}
```
Can also be written as a lambda expression:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val upperCaseString = {
        text:String -> text.uppercase()
    }
  println(upperCaseString("hello"))
}
```

Lambda expressions can be hard to understand at first glance so let's break it down. Lambda expressions are written within curly braces `{}`.

Within the lambda expression, you write:

- The parameters followed by an `->`.
- The function body after the `->`.

In the previous example:

- `text` is a function parameter.
- `text` has type `String`.
- The function returns the result of the `.uppercase()` function called on `text`.
- The entire lambda expression is assigned to the `upperCaseString` variable with the assignment operator `==`.
- The lambda expression is called by using the variable `upperCaseString` like a function and the string `"hello"` as a parameter.
- The `println()` function prints the result.

>âœ¨ If you declare a lambda without parameters, then there's no need to use `->`. For example:
>   ```kotlin
>   {println("Log message")}
>   ```

Lambda expressions can be used in a number of ways. You can: 

- Pass a lambda expression as a parameter to another function
- Return a lambda expression from a function
- Invoke a lambda expression on its own

###### **Pass to another function**

A great example of when it's useful to pass a lambda expression to a function, is using the `.filter()` function on collections:

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6)

val positives = numbers.filter{ x-> x > 0}

val isNegative = {x:Int -> x < 0}
val negatives = numbers.filter(isNegative)

println(positives) // [1, 3, 5]
println(negatives) // [-2, -4, -6]
```

The .filter() function accepts a lambda expression as a predicate:

- `{ x -> x > 0 }` takes each element of the list and returns only those that are positive.

- `{ x -> x < 0 }` takes each element of the list and returns only those that are negative.

This example demonstrates two ways of passing a lambda expression to a function:

- For positive numbers, the example adds the lambda expression directly in the .filter() function.

- For negative numbers, the example assigns the lambda expression to the isNegative variable. Then the isNegative variable is used as a function parameter in the .filter() function. In this case, you have to specify the type of function parameters (x) in the lambda expression.

>âœ¨If a lambda expression is the only function parameter, you can drop the function parentheses ():
>   ```kotlin
>   val positives = numbers.filter { x -> x > 0 }
>   ```
> This is an example of a trailing lambda, which is discussed in more detail at the end of this chapter.

Another good example, is using the `.map()` function to transform items in a collection:

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6)
val doubled = numbers.map { x -> x * 2 }

val isTripled = { x: Int -> x * 3 }
val tripled = numbers.map(isTripled)

println(doubled)
// [2, -4, 6, -8, 10, -12]
println(tripled)
// [3, -6, 9, -12, 15, -18]
```
The `.map()` function accepts a lambda expression as a transform function:

- `{ x -> x * 2 }` takes each element of the list and returns that element multiplied by 2.

- `{ x -> x * 3 }` takes each element of the list and returns that element multiplied by 3.

###### **Function types**

Before you can return a lambda expression from a function, you first need to understand **function types**.

You have already learned about basic types but functions themselves also have a type. Kotlin's type inference can infer a function's type from the parameter type. But there may be times when you need to explicitly specify the function type. The compiler needs the function type so that it knows what is and isn't allowed for that function.

The syntax for a function type has:

- Each parameter's type written within parentheses `()` and separated by commas `,`.
- The return type written after `->`.

For example: `(String) -> String` or `(Int, Int) -> Int`.

This is what a lambda expression looks like if a function type for `upperCaseString()` is defined:

```kotlin
val upperCaseString: (String) -> String = { text -> text.uppercase()}

fun main() {
    println(upperCaseString("hello")) // HELLO
}
```
if your lambda expression has no parameter then the parentheses `()` are left empty. For example: `() -> Unit`

>âœ¨You must declare parameter and return types either in the lambda expression or as a function type. Otherwise, the compiler won't be able to know what type your lambda expression is.
>For example, the following won't work:
>   ```kotlin
>   val upperCaseString = { str -> str.uppercase() }
>   ```

###### **Return from a function**

Lambda expressions can be returned from a function. So that the compiler understands what type the lambda expression returned is, you must declare a function type.

In the following example, the `toSeconds()` function has function type `(Int) -> Int` because it always returns a lambda expression that takes a parameter of type `Int` and returns an `Int` value.

This example uses a `when` expression to determine which lambda expression is returned when `toSeconds()` is called:

```kotlin
fun toSeconds(time:String): (Int)-> Int = when (time){
    "hour" -> { value -> value * 60 * 60 }
    "minute" -> { value -> value * 60 }
    "second" -> { value -> value }
    else -> { value -> value }
}

fun main() {
    val timesInMinutes = listOf(2, 10, 15, 1)
    val min2sec= toSeconds("minute")
    val totalTimeInSeconds = timesInMinutes.map(min2sec).sum()
    println("Total time is $totalTimeInSeconds secs") // Total time is 1680 secs
}
```

###### **Invoke separately**

Lambda expressions can be invoked on their own by adding parentheses `()` after curly braces `{}` and including any parameters within the parentheses:

```kotlin
println({text:String -> text.uppercase()}("hello")) // Hello
```

###### **Trailing lambdas**

As you have already seen, if a lambda expression is the only function parameter, you can drop the function parentheses `()`. If a lambda expression is passed as the last parameter of a function, then the expression can be written outside the function parentheses `()`. In both cases, this syntax is called a **trailing lambda**.

For example, the [.fold()]() function accepts an initial value and an operation:
 
```kotlin
// The initial value is zero. 
// The operation sums the initial value with every item in the list cumulatively.
println(listOf(1, 2, 3).fold(0, { x, item -> x + item })) // 6

// Alternatively, in the form of a trailing lambda
println(listOf(1, 2, 3).fold(0) { x, item -> x + item })  // 6
```
## Classes

Classes can contain:

- Constructors and initializer blocks
- Functions
- Properties
- Nested and inner classes
- Object declarations

To declare a class, use the `class` keyword:

```kotlin
class Customer
```

>âœ¨ Kotlin does not have a `new` keyword.

#### Constructors

A class in Kotlin has a **primary constructor** and possibly one or more **secondary constructors**. The primary constructor is declared in the class header, and it goes after the class name and optional type parameters.

```kotlin
class Person constructor(firstName: String)
```
If the primary constructor does not have any annotations or visibility modifiers; the `constructor` keyword can be omitted:

```kotlin
class Person(firstName: String)
```
The primary constructor initializes a class instance and its properties in the class header. The class header can't contain any runnable code. If you want to run some code during object creation, use **initializer blocks** inside the class body. Initializer blocks are declared with `init` keyword followed by curly braces. Write any code that you want to run within the curly braces.

During the initialization of an instance, the initializer blocks are executed in the same order as they appear in the class body, interleaved with the property initializers:

```kotlin
class InitOrDemo(name: String){
    val firstProperty = "First property: $name".also(::println)
    init {
        println("First initializer block that prints $name")
    }
    val secondProperty = "Second property: ${name.length}".also(::println)
  init {
      println("Second initializer block that prints ${name.length}")
  }
  
  // First property: hello
  
  // First initializer block that prints hello
  
  // Second property: 5
  
  // Second initializer block that prints 5
}
```
Primary constructor parameters can be used in the initializer blocks. They can also be used in property initializers declared in the class body:

```kotlin
class Customer(name: String){
    val customerKey = name.uppercase()
}
```

Kotlin has a concise syntax for declaring properties and initializing them from the primary constructor:

```kotlin
class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, var age: Int)
```

Such declarations can also include default values of the class properties:

```kotlin
class Person(val firstName:String, val lastName: String, var isEmployed: Boolean = true)
```

You can use a trailing comma when you declare class properties:

```kotlin
class Person(
    val firstName: String,
    val lasName: String,
    var isEmployed: Boolean,
) {}
```

Much like regular properties, properties declared in the primary constructor can be mutable (`var`) or read-only (`val`)

If the constructor has annotations or visibility modifiers, the `constructor` keyword is required and the modifiers go before it

```kotlin
class Customer public @Inject constructor(name: String)
```
Learn more about [visibility modifiers]()

#### Secondary constructors

A class can also declare **secondary constructors**, which are prefixed with `constructor`:

```kotlin
class Person(val pets: MutableList<Pet> = mutableListOf())

class Pet {
    constructor(owner: Person){
        owner.pets.add(this) // adds this pet to the list of its owner's pets
    }
}
```

If the class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to delegate to the primary constructor, either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor(s). Delegation to another constructor of the same class is done using the `this` keyword:

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String) {
    val children: MutableList<Person> = mutableListOf()
    constructor(name: String, parent: Person): this(name) {
        parent.children.add(this)
    }
}
```

Code in initializer blocks effectively becomes part of the primary constructor. Delegation to the primary constructor happens at the moment of access to the first statement of a secondary constructor, so the code in all initializer blocks and property initializers is executed before the body of the secondary constructor.

Even if the class has no primary constructor, the delegation still happens implicitly, and the initializer blocks are still executed:

```kotlin
class Constructors {
    init {
        println("Init block")
    }
  
    constructor(i: Int) {
        println("Constructor $i")
    }
}

// Init block
// Constructor 1

``` 

If a non-abstract class does not declare any constructors (primary or secondary), it will have a generated primary constructor with no arguments. The visibility of the constructor will be publc.

If you don't want your class to have a public constructor, declare an empty primary constructor with non-default visibility:

```kotlin
class DontCreateMe private constructor() {}
```

>âœ¨ On the JVM, if all of the primary constructor parameters have default values, the compiler will generate an additional parameterless constructor will use the default values. This makes it easier to use Kotlin with libraries such as Jackson or JPA that create class instances through parameterless constructors.
>   ```kotlin
>   class Customer(val customerName: String = "")
>   ```

#### Create instance

To create an object from a class, you can declare a class instance using a constructor.

By default, Kotlin automatically creates a constructor with the parameters declared in the class header.

For example:

```kotlin
class Contact(val id: Int, var email: String = "example@gmail.com")

fun main() {
    val contact= Contact(1, "mary@gmail.com")
}
```

In the example:

- `Contact` is a class.
- `contact` is an instance of the `Contact` class.
- `id` and `email` are properties.
- `id` and `email` are used with the default constructor to create `contact`.

Kotlin classes can have many constructors, including ones that you define yourself.


#### Properties

Characteristics of a class's object can be declared in properties. You can declare properties for a class:

- Within parentheses `()` after the class name.

```kotlin
class Contact(val id: Int, var email: String)
```
- Within the class body defined by curly braces `{}`.

```kotlin
class Contact(val id: Int, var email: String){
    val category: String = ""
}
```
We recommend that you declare properties as read-only (val) unless they need to be changed after an instance of the class is created.

You can declare properties without val or var within parentheses but these properties are not accessible after an instance has been created.
>âœ¨
>- The content contained within parentheses `()` is called the **class header**.
>- You can use a trailing comma when declaring class properties.

Just like with function parameters, class properties can have default values:

```kotlin
class Contact(val id: Int, var email: String = "example@gmail.com")
```

###### **Getters and setters**

The full syntax for declaring a property is as follows: 
```kotlin
var <propertyName>[: <PropertyType>] [= <property_initializer>]
    [<getter>]
    [<setter>]
```

The initializer, getter and setter are optional. The property type is optional if it can be inferred from the initializer or the getter's return type, as shown below:
```kotlin
var initialized = 1 // has type Int, default getter and setter

// var allByDefault // ERROR: explicit initializer required, default getter and setter implied
```
The full syntax of a read-only property declaration differs from a mutable one in two ways: it starts with `val` instead of `var` and does not allow a setter

```kotlin
val simple: Int? // has type Int, default getter, must be initialized in constructor
val inferredType = 1 // has type Int and a default getter
```

You can define custom accessors for a property. If you define a custom getter, it will be called every time you access the property (this way you can implement a computed property). Here's an example of a customer getter:

```kotlin
class Rectangle(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
  val area: Int get() = this.width * this.height // property type is optional since it can be inferred from the getter's return type.
}

/// Width=3, Height=4, area=12
```

You can omit the property type if it can be inferred from the getter:

```kotlin
val area get() = this.width * this.height
```

If you define a custom setter, it will be called every time you assign a value to the property, except its initialization. A custom setter looks like this:

```kotlin
var stringRepresentation: String 
  get() = this.toString()
  set(value) {
      setDataFromString(value) // Parses the string and assigns values to other properties
  }
```

By convention, the name of the setter parameter is `value`, but you can choose a different name if you prefer.

If you need to annotate an accessor or change its visibility, but you do not want to change the default implementation, you can define the accessor without defining its body:

```kotlin
var setterVisibility: String= "abc"
    private set // the setter is private and has the default implementation


var setterWithAnnotation: Any? = null 
    @Inject set // annotate the setter with Inject
```

 _Backing fields_

In Kotlin, a field is only used as a property to hold its value in memory. Fields cannot be declared directly. However, when a property needs a backing field, Kotlin provides it automatically. This backing field can be referenced in the accessors using the `field` identifier:

```kotlin
var counter = 0 // the initializer assigns the backing field directly
  set(value) {
      if(value >= 0){
          field = value
        // counter = value // ERROR StackOverflow: Using actual name 'counter' would make setter recursive
      }
  }
```

The `field` identifier can only be used in the accessors of the property.

A backing field will be generated for a property if it uses the default implementation of at least one of the accessors, or if a custom accessor references it through the `field` identifier.

For example, there would be no backing field in the following case:

```kotlin
val isEmpty: Boolean
  get() = this.size == 0
```

_Backing properties_

If you want to do something that does not fit into this **implicit backing field** scheme, you can always fall back to having a **backing property**:

```kotlin
private var _table: Map<String,Int>? = null
public val table: Map<String,Int>
  get() {
      if(_table == null) {
          _table = HashMap() // Type parameters are inferred
      }
      return _table ?: throw AssertionError("Set to null by another thread")
  }
```
>âœ¨ On the JVM: Access to private properties with default getters and setters if optimized to avoid function call overhead.
###### **Compile-time constants**

If the value of a read-only property is known at compile time, mark it as a **compile time constant** using the `const` modifier. Such a property needs to fulfill the following requirements:

- It must be a top-level property, or a member of an `object` declaration or a **companion object**.
- It must be initialized with a value of type `String` or a primitive type.
- It cannot be a custom getter.

The compiler will inline usages of the constant, replacing the reference to the constant with its actual value. However, the field will not be removed and therefore can be interacted with using `reflection`.

Such properties can also be used in annotations: 

```kotlin
const val SUBSYSTEM_DEPRECATED: String = "This subsystem is deprecated"
@Deprecated(SUBSYSTEM_DEPRECATED) fun foo(){}
```
###### **Late-initialized properties and variables**

Normally, properties declared as having a non-nullable type must be initialized in the constructor. However, it's often the case that doing so is not convenient. For example, properties can be initialized through dependency injection, or in the setup method of a unit test. In these cases, you cannot supply a non-nullable initializer in the constructor, but you still want to avoid null checks when referencing the property inside the body of a class.

To handle suc cases, you can mark the property with the `lateinit` modifier:

```kotlin
public class MyTest {
    lateinit var  subject: TestSubject
    
    @SetUp fun setup() {
        subject = TestSubject()
    }
    @Test fun test() {
        subject.method() // dereference directly
    }
}
```

This modifier can be used on `var` properties declared inside the body of a class (not in the primary constructor, and only when the property does not have a custom getter or setter), as well as for top-level properties and local variables. The type of the property or variable must be non-nullable, and it must not be a primitive type.

Accessing a `lateinit` property before it has been initialized throws a special exception that clearly identifies the property being accessed and the fact that it hasn't been initialized.

_Checking whether a `lateinit var` is initialized_

To check whether a `lateinit var` has already been initialized, use `.isInitialized` on the reference to that property:

```kotlin
if(foo::bar.isInitialized){
    println(foo.bar)
}
```

This check is only available for properties that are lexically accessible when declared in the same type, in one of the outer types, or at top level in the same file.

###### **Overriding properties**

See [Overriding properties](#overriding-properties-1)

###### **Delegated properties**

The most common kind of property simply reads from (and maybe writes to) a backing field, but custom getters and setters allow you to use properties so one can implement any sort of behavior of a property. Somewhere in between the simplicity Ã² the first kind and variety of the second, there are common patterns for what properties can do. A few examples: lazy values, reading from a map by a given key, accessing a database, notifying a listener on access.

Such common behaviors can be implemented as libraries using delegated properties.


#### Access properties

To access a property of an instance, write the name of the property after the instance name appended with a period `.`:

```kotlin
class Contact(val id: Int, var email: String)

fun main() {
    val contact = Contact(1,"mary@gmail.com")
  
    // Prints the value of the property: email
    println(contact.email) // mary@gmail.com
  
  
    // Updates the values of the property: email
    contact.email = "jane@gmail.com"
  
    println(contact.email) // jane@gmail.com
  
}
```

>âœ¨ To concatenate the value of a property as part of a string, you can use string templates (`$`). For example:
>   ```kotlin
>       println("Their email address is: ${contact.email}")    
>   ```

#### Member functions

In addition to declaring properties as part of an object's characteristics, you can also define an object's behavior with member functions.

In Kotlin, member functions must be declared within the class body. To call a member function on an instacne, write the function name after the instance name append with a period `.`. For example:

```kotlin
class Contact(val id: Int, var email: String) {
    fun printId() {
        println(id)
    }
}

fun main() {
    val contact = Contact(1, "mary@gmail.com")
    
    // Calls member function printId()
    contact.printId() // 1
}
```

#### Data classes

Kotlin has data classes which are particularly useful for storing data. Data classes have the same functionality as classes, but they come automatically with additional member functions. These member functions allow you to easily print the instance to readable output, compare instances of as class, copy instances, and more. As these functions are automatically available, you don't have to spend time writing the same boilerplate code for each of your classes.

To declare a data class, use the keyword `data`:

```kotlin
data class User (val name: String, val id: Int)
```

The most useful predefined member functions of data classes are: 

| Function     | Description|
|--------------|----------|
| `toString()` | Prints a readble string of the class instance and its properties.|
| `equals()` or `==`| Compares instances of a class|
| `copy()`| Create a class instance by copying another, potentially with some different properties.|

For example: 
```kotlin
val user = User("Alex", 1)
val secondUser = User("Alex", 1)
val thirdUser = User("Max", 2)

// Compares user to second user
println("user == secondUser: ${user == secondUser}") 
// user == secondUser: true

// Compares user to third user
println("user == thirdUser: ${user == thirdUser}")   
// user == thirdUser: false
```

#### Inheritance

All classes in Kotlin have a common superclass, `Any`, which is default superclass for a class with no supertypes declared:

```kotlin
class Example // Implicitly inherits from Any
```

`Any` has three methods: `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. Thus, these methods are defined for all Kotlin classes.

By default, Kotlin classes are final - they can't be inherited. To make a class inheritable, mark it with the `open` keyword:

```kotlin
open class Base // Class is open for inheritance
```

To declare an explicit supertype, place the type after a colon in the class header:

```kotlin
open class Base(p: Int)

class Derived(p: Int): Base(p)
```


If the derived class has a primary constructor, the base class can ( and must) be initialized in that primary constructor according to its parameters.

If the derived class has no primary constructor, then each secondary constructor has to initialize the base type using the `super` keyword or it has to delegate to another constructor which does. Please note that in this case different secondary constructors can call different constructors of the base type:
 
```kotlin
class MyView: View {
    constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx)
    constructor(ctx: Context, attrs: AttributeSet) : super(ctx,attrs) 
}
```

#### Interfaces

Interfaces in Kotlin can contain declarations of abstract methods, as well as method implementations. What makes them different from abstract classes is that interfaces cannot store state. They can have properties, but these need to be abstract or provide accessor implementations.

An interface is defined using the keyword `interface`:

```kotlin
interface MyInterface {
    fun bar()
    fun foo() {
        // optional body
    }
}
```
###### **Implementing interfaces**

A class or object can implement one or more interfaces:

```kotlin
class Child: MyInterface {
    override fun bar() {
        //body
    }
}
```

###### **Properties in interfaces**

You can declare properties in interfaces. A property declared in an interface can either be abstract or provide implementations for accessors. Properties declared in interfaces can't have backing fields, and therefore accessors declared in interfaces can't reference them:

```kotlin
interface MyInterface {
    val prop: Int // abstract
    
    val propertyWithImplementation: String 
      get() = "foo"
    fun foo() {
        println(prop)
    }
}

class Child: MyInterface {
    override val prop: Int = 29
}
```

###### **Interfaces Inheritance**

An interface can derive from other interfaces, meaning it can both provide implementations for their members and declare new functions and properties. Quite naturally, classes implementing such an interface are only required to define the missing implementations:

```kotlin
interface Named {
    val name: String
}

interface  Person: Named {
    val firstName: String 
    val lastName: String 
    override val name: String
      get() = "$firstName $lastName"
}

data class Employee(
    // Implementing 'name' is not required
    override val firstName: String,
    override val lastName: String, 
    val position: Position,
): Person
```

###### **Resolving overriding conflicts**

When you declare many types in your supertype list, you may inherit more than one implementation of the same method:

```kotlin
interface A {
    fun foo() {
        println("A")
    }
    fun bar()
}

interface B {
    fun foo() {
        println("B")
    }
    fun bar() {
        println("bar")
    }
}

class C: A {
    override fun bar() {
        println("bar")
    }
}

class D: A, B {
    override fun foo() {
        super<A>.foo()
        super<B>.foo()
    }
    override fun bar(){
        super<B>.bar()
    }
}

```

Interfaces **A** and **B** both declare functions **foo()** and **bar()**. Both of them implement **foo()**, but only **B** implement **bar()** (**bar()** is not marked as abstract in **A**, because this is the default for interfaces if the function has nobody). Now, if you derive a concrete class **C** from **A**, you have to override **bar()** and provide an implementation.

However, if you derive **D** from **A** and **B**, you need to implement all the methods that you have inherited from multiple interfaces, and you need to specify how exactly **D** should implement them. This rule applies both to methods for which you've inherited a single implementation (**bar()**) and to those for which you've inherited multiple implementations (**foo()**).

#### Overriding methods

Kotlin requires explicit modifiers for overridable members and overrides: 

```kotlin
open class Shape {
    
    open fun draw() {}
    fun fill(){}
}

class Circle(): Shape() {
    
    override fun draw(){
        
    }
}
```

The `override` modifier is required for `Circle.draw()`. If it's missing, the compiler will complain. If there's no `open` modifier on a function, like `Shape.fill()` , declaring a method with same signature in a subclass is not allowed, either with `override` or without it. The `open` modifier has no effect when added to members of a final class - a class without an `open` modifier.

A member marked `override` is itself open, so it may be overridden in subclasses. If you want to prohibit re-overriding, use `final`: 

```kotlin
open class  Rectangle(): Shape() { 
    final override fun draw(){}
}
```
#### Overriding properties

The overriding mechanism works on properties in the same way that it does on methods. Properties declared on a superclass that are then redeclared on a derived class must be prefaced with `override`, and must have a compatible type. Each declared property can be overridden by a property with an initializer or by a property with a `get` method.: 

```kotlin
open class Shape {
    open val vertexCount: Int = 0
}
class Rectangle(): Shape() {
    override val vertexCount: Int = 4
}
```
You can also override a `val` property with a `var` property, but not vice versa. This is allowed because a `val` property essentially declares a `get` method, and overriding it as a `var` additionally declares a `set` method in the derived class.

Note that you can use the `override` keyword as part of the property declaration in a primary constructor:

```kotlin
interface Shape {
    val vertexCount: Int
}

class Rectangle (override val vertexCount: Int = 4): Shape  // Always has 4 vertex

class Polygon : Shape {
    override val vertexCount: Int = 4 // Can be set to any number later
}
```

#### Derived class initialization order

During the construction of a new instance of a derived class, the base class initialization is done as the first step (preceded only by evaluation of the arguments for the base class constructor), which means that it happens before the initialization logic of the derived class is run.

```kotlin
open class Base (val name: String) {
    
    init {
        println("Initializing a bass class")
    }
  
    open val size: Int = name.length.also { 
        println("Initializing size in the base class: $it")
    }
}

class Derived ( name: String, val lastName: String,): Base( name.replaceFirstChar { it.uppercase() }.also { 
    println("Argument for the base class: $it")}){
        
    init {
        println("Initializing a derived class")
    }
  
    override val size: Int = (super.size + lastName.length).also { 
        println("Initializing size the derived class: $it")
    }
}

///  Constructing the derived class("hello", "world")
///  Argument for the base class: Hello
///  Initializing a base class
///  Initializing size in the base class: 5
///  Initializing a derived class
///  Initializing size in the derived class: 10
```
This means that when the bass class constructor is executed, the properties declared or overridden in the derived class have not yet been initialized. Using any of those properties in the base class initialization logic (either directly or indirectly through another overridden `open` member implementation) may lead to incorrect behavior or a runtime failure. When designing a base class, you should therefore avoid using `open` members in ths constructors, property initializers, or `init` blocks.

#### Calling the superclass implementation

Code in a derived class can call its superclass functions and property accessor implementations using the `super` keyword:

```kotlin
open class Rectangle {
    open fun draw() {
        println("Drawing a rectangle")
    }
  val borderColor: String get() = "black"
}

class FilledRectangle: Rectangle() {
    override fun draw() {
        super.draw()
        println("Drawing the rectangle")
    }
    val fillColor: String get()= super.borderColor
}
```

Inside an inner class, accessing the superclass of the outer class is done using the `super` keyword qualified with the outer class name: `super@Outher`: 

```kotlin
class FilledRectangle: Rectangle() {
    override fun draw() {
        val filler= Filler()
        filler.drawAndFill()
    }
    
  inner class Filler {
      fun fill(){
          println("Filling")
      }
    fun drawAndFill() {
        super@FilledRectangle.draw() // Calls Rectangle's implementation of draw()
        fill()
        println("Drawn a filled rectangle with color ${super@FilledRectangle.borderColor}")
    }
  }
}

/// Drawing a rectangle
/// Filling
/// Drawn a filled rectangle with color black
```

#### Overriding rules

In Kotlin, implementation inheritance regulated by the following rule: If a class inherits multiple implementations of the same member from its immediate superclasses, it must override this member and provide its own implementation (perhaps, using one of the inherited ones).

To denote the supertype from which the inherited implementation is taken, use `super` qualified by the supertype name in angle braces, such as `super<Base>`:

```kotlin
open class Rectangle {
    open fun draw() {}
}

interface Polygon {
    fun draw() {}
}

class Square : Rectangle(), Polygon {
    // The compiler requires draw() to be overridden.
    override fun draw() {
        super<Rectangle>.draw() // Call to Rectangle.draw()
        super<Polygon>.draw() // Call to Polygon.draw()
    }
}



```
It's fine to inherit from both `Rectangle` and `Polygon`, but both of them have their implementations of `draw()`, so you need to override `draw()` in `Square` and provide a separate implementation  for it to eliminate the ambiguity.

## Null safety

In Kotlin, it's possible to have a `null` value. Kotlin use `null` values when something is missing or not yet set. You've already seen an example of Kotlin returning a null value in the Collections chapter when you tried to access a key-value pair with a key that does not exist in the map. Although it's useful to use `null` values in this way, you might run into problems if your code isn't prepared to handle them.

To help prevent issues with `null` values in your programs, Kotlin has null safety in place. Null safety detects potential problems with `null` values at compile time, rather than at run time.

Null safety is combination of features that allow you to:

- Explicitly declare when `null` values are allowed in your program.

- Check for `null` values.

- Use safe calls to properties or functions that may contain `null` values.

- Declare actions to take if `null` values are detected.

#### Nullable types

Kotlin supports nullable types which allows the possibility for the declared type to have `null` values. By default, a type is **not** allowed to accept `null` values. Nullable types are declared by explicitly adding `?` after the type declaration.

For example:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // neverNull has String type
    var neverNull: String = "This can't be null"
  
    // Throws a compiler error
    neverNull = null
    
    // nullable has nullable String yupe
    var nullable: String? = "You can keep a null here" 
  
    // This is OK
    nullable = null 
  
    // By default, null values aren't accepted
    var inferredNonNull = "The compiler assumes non-nullable"
  
    // Throws a compiler error 
    inferredNonNull = null 
  
    // notNull doesn't accept null values
    fun strLength(notNull: String): Int {
        return notNull.length;
    }
  
    println(strLength(neverNull)) // 18
    println(strLength(nullable)) // Throws a compiler error
  
}
```

#### Check for null values

You can check for the presence of `null` values within conditional expressions. In the following example, the `describeString()` function has an `if` statement that check whether `maybeString` is **not** `null` and if its `length` is greater than zero:

```kotlin
fun describeString(maybeString: String?): String{
    if (maybeString != null && maybeString.length > 0){
        return "Length of string ${maybeString.length}"
    }else {
        return "Empty or null string"
    }
}

fun main() {
    val nullString: String? = null 
    println(describeString(nullString)) // Empty or null string
}
```

#### Use safe calls

To safely access properties of an object that might contain a `null` value, use the safe call operator `?.`. The safe call operator returns `null` if either the object or one of its accessed properties is `null`. This is useful if you want to avoid the presence of `null` values triggering errors in your code. 

In the following example, the `lengthString()` function uses a safe call to return either the length of the string or `null`:

```kotlin
fun lengthString(maybeString: String?): Int? = maybeString?.length

fun main() {
    val nullString: String? = null 
    println(lengthString(nullString)) // null
}
```

>âœ¨ Safe calls can be chained so that if any property of an object contains a `null` value, then `null` is returned without an error being thrown. For example:
>    ```kotlin
> person.company?.address?.country
>    ```


To safe call operator can also be used to safely call an extension or member function. In this case, a null check is performed before the function is called. If the check detects a `null` value, then the call is skipped and `null` is returned.

In the following example, `nullString` is `null` so the invocation of `.uppercase()` is skipped and `null` is returned:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val nullString: String? = null 
    println(nullString?.uppercase()) // null
}
```

#### Use Elvis operator

You can provide a default value to return if a `null` value is detected by using the **Elvis operator** `?:`.

Write on the left-hand side of the Elvis operator what should be checked for a `null` value. 
Write on the right-hand side of the Elvis operator what should be returned if a `null` value is detected.

In the following example, `nullString` is `null` so the safe call to access the `length` property returns a `null` value. As a result, the Elvis operator returns `0`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val nullString: String? = null 
    println(nullString?.length ?: 0) //0
}
```

## Idioms

A collection of random and frequently used idioms in Kotlin.

#### Create DTOs (POJOs/POCOs)

```kotlin
data class Customer( val name: String, val email: String)
```

provides a `Customer` class with the following functionality:

- getters(and setters in case of `var` s) for all properties
- `equals()`
- `hashCode()`
- `toString()`
- `copy()`
- `component1()`, `component2()`,..., for all properties

#### Default values for function parameters

```kotlin
fun foo(a: Int =0, b: String = ""){}
```

#### Filter a list

```kotlin
val positives = list.filter {x: Int -> x > 0}
```
Or alternatively, even shoter:

```kotlin
val positives = list.filter {it > 0}
```

#### Check the presence of an element in a collection

```kotlin
if ("john@example.com" in emailList){}
```

#### String interpolation

```kotlin
println("Name $name")
```

#### Read standard input safely

```kotlin
// Reads a string and returns null if the input can't be converted into an integer. For example: Hi there!
val wrongInt = readln().toIntOrNull()
println(wrongInt)
// null

// Reads a string that can be converted into an integer and returns an integer. For example: 13
val correctInt = readln().toIntOrNull()
println(correctInt)
// 13
```

#### Instance checks

```kotlin
when(x) {
    is Foo -> ...
    is Bar -> ...
    else -> ...
}
```

#### Read-only list

```kotlin
val list = listOf("a", "b", "c")
```

#### Read-only map


```kotlin
val map = mapOf("a" to 1, "b" to 2, "c" to 3)
```


#### Access a map entry

```kotlin
println(map["key"])

map["key"]= value
```

#### Traverse a map or a list of pairs

```kotlin
for ((k,v) in map) {
    println("$k -> $v")
}
```

#### Iterate over a range

```kotlin
for (i in 1..100) {} // closed-ended range: includes 100
for (i in 1..<100){} // open-ended range: does not include 100
for (i in 1..100 step 2) // 2, 4, 6, ... 100
for (i in 100 downTo 1) // 100, 99, ... 1
(1..10).forEach {}
```

#### Lazy property


```kotlin
val p: String by lazy {
    // The value is computed only on first access
    // compute the string
}
```

#### Extension functions 


```kotlin
fun String.spaceToCamelCase() {}

"Convert this to camelcase".spaceToCamelCase()
```

#### Create a singleton


```kotlin
object Resource {
    val name: String = "Name"
}
```

#### Use inline value classes for type-safe values

```kotlin
@JvmInline
value class EmployeeId(private val id: String)

@JvmInline
value class CustomerId(private val id: String)
```

If you accidentally mix up `EmployeeId` and `CustomerId`, a compilation error is triggered.

>âœ¨ The `@JvmInline` annotation is only needed for JVM backends.

#### Instantiate an abstract class

```kotlin
abstract class MyAbstractClass {
  abstract fun doSomething()
  abstract fun sleep()
}

fun main() {
  val myObject = object : MyAbstractClass() {
    override fun doSomething() {
      TODO("Not yet implemented")
    }

    override fun sleep() {
      TODO("Not yet implemented")
    }
  }
  myObject.doSomething()
}
```

#### If-not-null shorthand

```kotlin
val files = File("Test").listFiles()

println(files?.size) // size is printed if files is not null
```


#### If-not-null-else shorthand

```kotlin
val files = File("Test").listFiles()

// For simple fallback values:
println(files?.size ?: "empty") // if files is null, this prints "empty"

// To calculate a more complicated fallback value in a code block, use `run`

val filesSize: Double = files?.size ?: run {
    val someSize = getSomeSize()
    someSize * 2  
}

println(filesSize)

```

#### Execute a statement if null

```kotlin

val values = ...
val email = values["email"] ?: throw IllegalStateException("Email is missing!")
```

#### Get first item of a possibly empty collection

```kotlin
val emails= ...
val mainEmail = emails.firstOrNull() ?: ""
```

#### Execute if not null 

```kotlin
val value: String? =null 

value?.let{
    /// execute this block if not null
}
```

#### Map nullable value if not null

```kotlin
val value = ...

val mapped = value?.let{
    transformValut(it)
} ?: defaultValue
```
#### Return on when statement

```kotlin
fun transform(color: String): Int {
    return when(color){
        "red" -> 0
        "green" -> 1
        "yellow" -> 2
        else -> throw IllegalStateException("Invalid color param value")
    }
}
```

#### try-catch expression

```kotlin
import java.lang.ArithmeticException

fun test() {
    val result = try {
        count()
    } catch (e: ArithmeticException){
        throw IllegalStateException(e)
    }
  // Working with result
}
```

#### if expression

```kotlin
val result: String = if (x == 1){
    "one"
} else if (x == 2) {
    "two"
} else {
    "other"
}
```

#### Builder-style usage of methods that return Unit

```kotlin
fun arrayOfMinusOnes(size: Int): IntArray {
    return IntArray(size).apply { fill(-1) }
}
```

#### Single-expression functions

```kotlin
fun theAnswer() = 42
```
This is equivalent to

```kotlin
fun theAnswer(): Int {
    return 42
}
```

This can be effectively combined with other idioms, leading to shorter code. For example, with the `when` expression:

```kotlin
fun transform(color: String): Int = when (color) {
    "Red" -> 0
    "Green" -> 1
    "Blue" -> 2
    else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Invalid color param value")
}
```

#### Call multiple methods on an object instance (with)

```kotlin
class Turtle {
    fun penDown()
    fun penUp()
    fun turn(degrees: Double)
    fun forward(pixels: Double)
}

val myTurtle = Turtle()
with(myTurtle) { //draw a 100 pix square
    penDown()
    for (i in 1..4) {
        forward(100.0)
        turn(90.0)
    }
    penUp()
}
```

#### Configure properties of an object (apply)

```kotlin
val myRectangle = Rectangle().apply {
    length = 4
    breadth = 5
    color = 0xFAFAFA
}
```
This is useful for configuring properties that aren't present in the object constructor.

#### Java 7's try-with-resources


```kotlin
val stream = Files.newInputStream(Paths.get("/some/file.txt"))
stream.buffered().reader().use { reader ->
    println(reader.readText())
}
```

#### Generic function that requires the generic type information

```kotlin
//  public final class Gson {
//     ...
//     public <T> T fromJson(JsonElement json, Class<T> classOfT) throws JsonSyntaxException {
//     ...

inline fun <reified T: Any> Gson.fromJson(json: JsonElement): T = this.fromJson(json, T::class.java)
```
#### Swap two variables

```kotlin
var a = 1
var b = 2
a = b.also { b = a }
```
#### Mark code as incomplete (TODO)

Kotlin's standard library has a `TODO()` function that will always throw a `NotImplementedError`. Its return type is `Nothing` so it can be used regardless of expected type. There's also an overload that accepts a reason parameter:

```kotlin
fun calcTaxes(): BigDecimal = TODO("Waiting for feedback from accounting")
```

IntelliJ IDEA's kotlin plugin understands the semantics of TODO() and automatically adds a code pointer in the TODO tool window.

## Packages and imports

A source file may start with a package declaration.

```kotlin
package org.example

fun printMessage(){
    
}

class Message{}
```

All the contents, such as classes and functions, of the source file are included in this package. So, in the example above, the full name of `printMessage()` is `org.example.printMessage`, and the full name of `Message` is `org.example.Message`.

If the package is not specified, the contents of such a file belong to the `default` package with no name.

#### Default imports 

A number of packages are imported into every Kotlin file by default:

- kotlin.*
- kotlin.annotation.*
- kotlin.collections.*
- kotlin.comparisons.*
- kotlin.io.*
- kotlin.ranges.*
- kotlin.sequences.*
- kotlin.text.*

Additional packages are imported depending on the target platform:

- JVM:
  - java.lang.*
  - kotlin.jvm.*
- JS:
  - kotlin.js.*

#### Imports

Apart from the default imports, each file may contain its own `import` directives.

You can import either a single name:

```kotlin
import org.example.Message // Message is now accessible without qualification.
```
or all the accessible contents of a scope: package, class, object, and so on:

```kotlin
import org.example.* // everything in `org.example` becomes accessible
```

If there's a name clash, you can disambiguate by using `as` keyword to locally rename the clashing entity:

```kotlin
import org.example.Message // Message is accessible
import org.test.Message as TestMessage // TestMessage stands for `org.test.Message`
```

The `import` keyword is not restricted to importing classes, you can also use it to import other declarations:

- top-level functions and properties
- functions and properties declared in [object declarations]()
- [enum constants]()

#### Visibility of top-level declarations

If a top-level declaration is marked `private`, it's private to the file it's declared in, see [Visibility modifiers]() 




## Kotlin for Android

You can benefit from:

- **Less code combined with greater readability:** Spend less time writing your code and working to understand the code of others.
- **Fewer common errors:** Apps built with Kotlin are 20% less likely to crash by on Google's internal data.
- **Kotlin support in Jetpack libraries:** Jetpack Compose is Android's recommended modern toolkit for building native UI in Kotlin. KTX extension and Kotlin language features, like coroutines, extension functions, lambdas, and named parameters to existing Android libraries.
- **Support for multiplatform development:** Kotlin Multiplatform, JetBrain's declarative UI framework based on Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, makes it possible to share UIs across platforms - iOS, Android, desktop, and web.
- **Mature language and environment:** Since Ã­t creation in 2011, Kotlin has developed continuously, not only as a language but as a whole ecosystem with robust tooling. Now it's seamlessly integrated into Android Studio and is actively used by many companies for developing Android application.
- **Interoperability wih Java:** You can use Kotlin along with the Java programming language in your applications without needing to migrate all your code to Kotlin.
- **Easy leaning:** Kotlin is very easy to learn, especially for Java developers.
- **Big community:** Kotlin has great support and many contributions from the community, which is growing all over the world. Over 95% of top thousand Android apps use Kotlin.
