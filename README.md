# 30 days of Kotlin

## Setup

## Variables and Data Types
In Kotlin, variables are declared using two keywords:
- val for immutable variables (values that can't be changed).
- var for mutable variables (values that can be changed).
  Example:

```kotlin
val name: String = "John"  // immutable variable
var age: Int = 25          // mutable variable
```

You can also let Kotlin infer the type:

```kotlin
val country = "USA"        // Kotlin infers that 'country' is of type String
var temperature = 30       // 'temperature' is of type Int
```

## Control Structures

Kotlin has familiar control structures like `if`, `when`, `for` and `while`.

#### If Statement:

The `if` statement works just like in many languages, but in Kotlin, it can also be an expression (it returns a value).

```kotlin
val max = if (a > b) a else b
```

#### When Expression (similar to switch in other languages):

```kotlin
val day = 3
val dayName = when (day){
    1 -> "Monday"
    2 -> "Tuesday"
    3 -> "Wednesday"
    4 -> "Thursday"
    5 -> "Friday"
    6 -> "Saturday"
    7 -> "Sunday"
    else -> "Unknown"
}
```

#### `for` loop

`for` loops are typically used to iterate over ranges, arrays, or collections.

Base Syntax:

```kotlin
for (item in collection){
    // Do something with item
}
```

Example: Iterating over a Range

```kotlin
for (i in 1..5){
    println(i) // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
}
```

- 1..5 is range from 1 to 5 (inclusive).
- You can also use `until` if you don't want to include the last value:

```kotlin
for (i in 1 until 5){
    println(i)
}
```

Example: Iterating over an Array

```kotlin
val numbers = arrayOf(1,2,3,4,5)
for (i in numbers){
    println(i)
}
```

Example: Iterating with an index

If you need both the index and the value:

```kotlin
val items = listOf("apple","banana","kiwi")
for ((index,value) in items.withIndex()){
    println("Item at $index is $value")
}
```
